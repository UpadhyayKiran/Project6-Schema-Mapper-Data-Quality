# Project6-Schema-Mapper-Data-Quality
An app that suggests a mapping to a canonical schema (with confidence), runs a deterministic clean/validate pass, and—only when issues remain—surfaces targeted fixes. Over time, routine cleaning should require fewer interventions


**Note**:
- Run pip install -r requirements.txt for dependencies installations
- Use **streamlit run main.py** for better UI experience.
- Use **streamlit run app.py** for better efficeincy and low latency.
